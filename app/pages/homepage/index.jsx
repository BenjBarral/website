        <P>I'm a web developer based in London. My hobbies include eating 🌯, skateboarding, coding 💻, listening to music 🎵, playing guitar 🎸 and standing ontop of things 🏔. I'm an aspiring vegan 🌿 too so hit me up if you have any agricultural projects you think we could collab on. Dont hesitate to drop me an email, tweet or any of the plethora of ways we can get in touch.</P>
